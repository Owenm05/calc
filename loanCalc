# This program will calculate the monthly payments of a loan

# Ask user to input the loan amount
amount = float(input("What is the loan amount? "))

# Ask user to input the interest rate
rate = float(input("What is the interest rate? "))

# Calculate the monthly interest rate
monthly_rate = rate / 1200

# Ask user to input the loan duration in years
years = int(input("What is the loan duration in years? "))

# Calculate the number of payments
payments = years * 12

# Calculate the monthly payments
monthly_payment = amount * monthly_rate / (1 - (1 / (1 + monthly_rate) ** payments))

# Print the result
print("Your monthly payment is $" + str(round(monthly_payment, 2)))
